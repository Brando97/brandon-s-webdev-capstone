<p>Dark souls is a third person role playing game that challenges you every step of the way. Travel throughout the scenic world defeating enemies such as skeletons, the undead to dragons, and bosses more challenging than the last. Be careful traviling through the world you will come across players looking to disrupt your game and harm you, they are also known as dark spirits in-game. Some may be lower skill level than you and be easy to slay, others may be more difficult than any boss you've  faced.</p>
